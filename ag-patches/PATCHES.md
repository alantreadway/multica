# AG patches

Patch inventory for the `ag/<tag>` branch. Update this file whenever a patch
lands, is dropped or is reworked during a rebase. The upstream base, the upstream
checks at each rebase and the builds are in [`BUILDS.md`](./BUILDS.md).

## Upstream status

Where each patch stands against `multica-ai/multica`, so we can decide which to
offer upstream. Every patch entry below ends with an **Upstream** line:

- **Status:**
  - `fork-only`: not worth offering (or upstream is already building the same
    thing and we won't race it).
  - `candidate`: worth offering. Nothing is proposed yet; upstream's
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` and our contribution routing want a Feature Request
    agreed before a feature PR.
  - `proposed <link>`: an upstream issue or PR is open for it.
  - `merged upstream in <tag>`: drop the patch at the next rebase.
  - `superseded by <link>`: upstream shipped something that replaces it; drop it
    at the next rebase.
- **Overlap:** related upstream PRs and issues, with their state when last checked.
- **Fit:** how it sits with upstream's `VISION.md` and roadmap, or why it doesn't.

Re-check on every rebase (README, "Rebase onto a new upstream tag") and log
the result in [`BUILDS.md`](./BUILDS.md).

### Ranking

Rows are ordered by how likely an upstream PR built from the patch would be
merged. Some patches appear in two parts where only one part is worth offering.

- **Fit:** how closely the patch matches what upstream has asked for or already
  ships: open requests, reactions, maintainer comments, precedent in the code.
- **Likelihood:** the chance a PR would merge, given its route (a bug fix can go
  straight to a PR; a feature needs a Feature Request agreed first), its size,
  competing PRs and the maintainers' stated position. For scale, about 55% of
  external PRs merge, at a median of 26h, and most of the rest stall unreviewed
  (the `multica-upstream-contribution` skill's evidence, 2026-10-15).
- **Next step:** what to do if we offer it. Nothing is opened upstream without
  alan's go-ahead for that item.

| # | Patch | Status | Overlapping upstream | Fit | Likelihood | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

`VISION.md` is a statement of direction (humans and agents as one team, work and
decisions kept visible), not a feature list. None of the patches conflicts with
it and none advances it directly; the fit lines below stay modest because
upstream closes PRs it reads as out of scope.

## Patches

Test names for every patch start with `AG patch:` so they are easy to find and
to confirm survived a rebase (`grep -rn "AG patch:" packages/`).

Fork code stays out of upstream files where it can, so a rebase conflicts less:

- AG tests live in sibling files (`*.ag.test.ts(x)`, `ag_*_test.go`) beside the
  upstream test they extend. Upstream test files keep only edits a patch's
  behaviour forces (each is listed under its patch).
- New queries go in `server/pkg/db/queries/ag_*.sql`, so sqlc writes them to
  `ag_*.sql.go` instead of upstream's generated files.
- UI strings live in the `ag` i18n namespace, `packages/views/locales/<lang>/ag.json`
  (keys mirror the upstream namespace they sit beside, e.g.
  `issues.swimlane.jump_to_lane`). `locales/ag.ts` adds it to `RESOURCES` and
  `i18n/ag-resources-types.ts` to `I18nResources`, through one hook line each in
  `locales/index.ts` and `i18n/resources-types.ts`. Upstream's locale JSON is
  unchanged. The tree-ordered lanes patch carries this scaffolding.
- `ApiClient` methods are in `packages/core/api/ag-client.ts`, installed onto
  the class by one hook line at the end of `client.ts`.
- An AG sibling test that renders an upstream component reuses the setup of
  the upstream test beside it (its store priming, query mocks and render
  helpers) rather than writing its own, so an upstream change to how the
  component loads shows up in both. Export the helper from the upstream test
  file only if there is no other way; that is an upstream-file edit to list.

## Tooling (not a patch)

`ag-patches/` and `.github/workflows/ag-patches.yml` exist only on the patch
branches and do not touch product code. Landed in
[#1](https://github.com/alantreadway/multica/pull/1). No patch edits them:
`ag-patches/test.sh` finds each patch's tests by diffing against the upstream
tag (see its header), so a patch only adds tests.
